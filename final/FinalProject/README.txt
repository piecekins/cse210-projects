There is a menu that has 8 options.
  1. Brew Potion, will not work unless you have ingredients. If you have ingredients
  then it will let you make a potion that will display use the name you gave and show
  all the properties even the ones that were affected by the ingredients.

  2. Make Property, works right off the bat, you give it an name of the property and 
  what it subtracts, then it will make 2 properties, the one you made and the opposite
  and add them to the list of properties for use later. 

  3. Add ingredient, will not work unless you make or load properties. It makes two kind of
  ingredients, type one is where it only buffs a property, you tell it what the name is, and
  what property you want it to buff, then it will ask you if you want a debuff, if you say no then
  it will make that ingredient with no debuff if you say anything else it will ask what property
  you want to debuff after you answer then it will make an ingredient with that data and add it to
  a list. Note you are only able to add properties you have already made.

  4. Show Properties, will display all properties and and what they add and substract.

  5. Show ingredents, will display all ingredients and their buffs and debuffs.

  6. Save, will save ingerdients and properties, to ingredients.txt and properties.txt.

  7. Load,  will load ingerdients and properties from ingredients.txt and properties.txt.
